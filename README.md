##Introduction
Analysis of NYC Subway Metagenome data

See follow-up  (http://microbe.net/2015/02/17/the-long-road-from-data-to-wisdom-and-from-dna-to-pathogen/)

##DATA
State where and when we obtained data files

Which samples were said to contain anthrax

##CONTROLS
Mix up real B. anthracis and B. cereus genomes

##Searching for pXO1 and pXO2 using BWA
Compare results from metagenome samples with positive controls

##Using Kraken to search for the *B. anthracis* chromosome

##B. anthracis specific SNPs (Sandeep)
