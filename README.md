##Introduction
Analysis of NYC Subway Metagenome data
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405471215000022
See follow-up apologia and discussions:

The question is - why did the software give false positive results and what exactly was found in the subway?  

##DATA
State where and when we obtained data files

Which samples were said to contain anthrax

##CONTROLS (Robert)
Mix up real B. anthracis and B. cereus genomes

##Searching for pXO1 and pXO2 using BWA (Robert)
Compare results from metagenome samples with positive controls

##Using Kraken to search for the *B. anthracis* chromosome
(Matthew - add your analysis of B. anthracis put through Kraken.)  
We need to analysis fastq data from a B. anthracis WGS project through Kraken.  


##B. anthracis specific SNPs (Sandeep)
